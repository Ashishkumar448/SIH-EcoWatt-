### Key Components:
- **Energy Consumption Tracking**: Users can manually input their energy usage data or automatically sync data from smart devices.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: The system uses advanced AI algorithms to detect patterns, forecast energy demand, and identify optimization opportunities.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, users receive tailored advice on how to adjust their energy usage for maximum efficiency.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to track energy consumption trends, set goals, and monitor progress.
- **Community Engagement**: Users can share tips and participate in challenges to further reduce energy consumption.

## Key Features

- **Daily Monitoring**: Continuously collects and analyzes data from sensors and IoT devices across the city.
- **Predictive Energy Management**: AI forecasts energy needs and proactively adjusts distribution to prevent wastage.
- **User Dashboard**: An intuitive interface that allows users to track their energy usage and make informed decisions.
- **Compatibility**: Integrates seamlessly with existing devices such as smart thermostats, plugs, and meters.
- **Remote Control Integration**: Users can remotely adjust device settings via their smartphone to optimize energy use on the go.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: For building an adaptive web interface.

### Backend:
- **Python**: For server-side logic, AI algorithms, and data processing.
- **MySQL**: For managing and storing energy usage data.
- **Flask**: For building the web application framework.

### AI and Data Processing:
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For implementing AI algorithms such as LSTM, ARIMA, and CNNs.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data analysis and machine learning tasks.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks, including OCR for meter readings.

## Installation

To set up the EcoWatt platform locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcoWatt.git
   cd EcoWatt
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and Activate it**
   ```cmd
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
   ``` cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application:**
   ```cmd
   flask run
   ```

## Usage

Once the platform is up and running, users can log in and start tracking their energy consumption. The AI-driven analytics will provide personalized recommendations based on the data collected from both manual inputs and smart device integrations. Users can also engage with the community, set energy-saving goals, and monitor their progress through the dashboard.
